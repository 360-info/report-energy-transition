The bubbles on this map concern a country's electricity supply and how that electricity is generated. There are two measures available: the _installed capacity_, which represents the amount of electrical power a country can produce, and the _generated energy_, which represents the amount of electricity actually produced.

These measure might differ for many reasons: perhaps a source of electricity is only operational for part of the year, for example.

Regardless of the measure used, the bubbles are shaded according to the fraction of electricity (or electrical power) that comes from **renewable sources**, with [**green tones representing more renewable electricity**]{style="color: #3595ac;"} and [**brown tones representing fewer renewables**]{style="color: #a1661a"}. The renewable sources in this dataset include:

:::{style="column-count: 2;"}
* Solar photovoltaic
* Solar thermal energy
* Onshore wind energy
* Offshore wind energy
* Renewable hydropower
* Mixed Hydro Plants
* Pumped storage
* Marine energy
* Solid biofuels
* Renewable municipal waste
* Liquid biofuels
* Biogas
* Geothermal energy
