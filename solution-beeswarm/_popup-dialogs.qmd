## About {#modal-about-title}
</header>

:::: {#modal-about-content}
This chart summarises data on the cost and efficacy of solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's](https://www.ipcc.ch) [Climate Change 2022: Mitigating Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport.pdf).

Solutions here are evaluated on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they could avoid each year. This estimate is subject to uncertainty that is not displayed here; the IPCC's graphic (Technical Summary Figure TS.23) shows this uncertainty.

The solutions are also broken down into "cost buckets" to show how much of a solution can b e implemented either "cost-negative" (that is, saving money) or at low, medium, high or very high cost. There is also uncertainty associated with the proportions that fall into these cost buckets; the IPCC did not evaluate this.
